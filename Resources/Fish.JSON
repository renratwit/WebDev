Thus these fish are often found using their prehensile tails to hold tight in amongst the sea grass. And here's one final fact for you...

Its light is apparently powered by luminous bacteria and other glowing microorganisms. One theory says it can spray these luminescent sidekicks when prey approaches in order to dazzle them...The deep contains many mysteries...as well as some things that are just sort of odd and off-putting."
